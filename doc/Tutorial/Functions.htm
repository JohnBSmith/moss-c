<h2 id="rec">Recursion</h2>

<p>Let <code>sum</code> be a function that takes two arguments
<code>a,b</code> and returns their sum <code>a+b</code>. There is a
recursive algorithm which only needs the functions successor and
predecessor to perform the computation.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
succ = sub|x| x+1 end
pred = sub|x| x-1 end

sum = sub|a,b|
  return if b==0 then a else sum(succ(a),pred(b)) end
end
</pre>

<p>Inside of the last function there is a call to the global variable
<code>sum</code> which points to the function itself. Note that
because of this we are not allowed to change the name of the function
and overwrite its old name. Instead of using a global variable we
can use a private variable which will point to the function itself more
directly. Then overwriting the old name becomes possible.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
sum = sub f|a,b|
  return if b==0 then a else f(succ(a),pred(b)) end
end

# Now valid
old_sum = sum
sum = some_other_function
</pre>

<h2 id="pf">Passing functions</h2>

<p>Normal control flow has a specific restriction which is dissolved
if we regard functions as objects that can be stored in variables
and passed to other functions.
</p>

<p>In normal control flow a program can call a subprogram which
can call another subprogram which can call another subprogram
and so on. The program can choose which subprogram is called
by using if-statements, but <i>knows</i> already what subprograms
are avaiable. What if the program <i>does not</i> know about
the subprograms it can call? Not that the number of possible
subprograms is too large, but that the
program really does not know the subprogram in before.
</p>

<p>If the subprogram to call is stored in a global variable,
a compound object or passed as an argument, the program only needs
to know the subprogram just before the call.
</p>

<p>One of the easiest examples is the function <code>map</code>
which applies a given function to each element of a list.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
map = sub|a,f|
  b=[]
  for x in a
    b.push(f(x))
  end
  return b
end

A = [1,2,3,4]
F = |x| 2*x
print(map(A,F))
# Output:
# [2, 4, 6, 8]
</pre>

<p>Interestingly, passing functions allows the construction of custom
control structures. A basic for loop is written without much effort.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
For = sub|a,b,f|
  i=a
  while i<=b
    f(i)
    i++
  end
end

For(1,4,sub|i|
  print(i, "^ = ", str(2^i).rjust(2,"0"))
end)
# 2^1 = 02
# 2^2 = 04
# 2^3 = 08
# 2^4 = 16
</pre>


<h2 id="currying">Currying
</h2>

<p>Let us implement numerical differentiation.
The first way one can think to do this, is to use the
definition of the derivative directly.
</p>
<pre class="moss">
diff = sub|f,x| h=0.001
  return (f(x+h)-f(x))/h
end
</pre>
<p>This is a little bit naive. The following algorithm does it
better, because it cancels out errors.
</p>
<pre class="moss">
diff = sub|f,x| h=0.001
  return (f(x+h)-f(x-h)/(2*h)
end
</pre>

<p>The differential operator can also be seen as an operator that
takes a function and returns a function (the derivative). If we
use currying, we can use both views directly.
</p>
<pre class="moss">
D = |f| |x| diff(f,x)
</pre>
<p>Now <code>D</code> is the differential operator, <code>D(f)</code>
is the first derivative and <code>D(f)(x)</code> is the same
as <code>diff(f,x)</code>. And that is simply currying. The
operator&nbsp;<code>D</code> is the curried form of <code>diff</code>.
</p>


<h2 id="closures">
Closures</h2>

<p>In Moss we are able to generate functions from data at runtime.
To achieve this, it must be possible to bind some data to a
function dynamicly. Such a binding is called <em>closure</em>.
</p>

<p>A simple example is the conversion of a list <code>a</code>
into a function <code>f</code>, so
that <code>f(i)==a[i]</code> for all indices of <code>a</code>.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
&gt; fn = |a| |i| a[i]
&gt; f = fn([4,2,3,1])
</pre>

<p>Furthermore, the bound data can itself be a function, because data,
that are all kinds of objects. A basic example is again the
differential operator.
</p>


<h2 id="rp">
Reference parameters</h2>

<p>Moss has only (only has) "call by value". The following code does not work, because <code>city</code> is called by value. We cannot modify the variable <code>city</code> from inside of the function <code>stars</code>.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
sub stars(s)
  s="*"+s+"*"
end

city = "London"
stars(city)
print(city)
# London
</pre>

<p>If we want reference parameters we have to use a reference variable. Such a variable can be simulated as a list with only one element.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
sub stars(a)
  a[0]="*"+a[0]+"*"
end

city = ["London"]
stars(city)
print(city[0])
# *London*
</pre>

<p>An object can be used instead of a list.
If there are many arguments, this has better readability.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
sub stars(s)
  s.value = "*"+s.value+"*"
end

city = object()
city.value = "London"
stars(city)
print(city.value)
# *London*
</pre>

<h2 id="var">
Variadic functions</h2>

<p>If the formal argument of a function is prefixed by an asterisk,
the argument list might have any argument count and will be
automatically converted into a list.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
&gt; p = |*a| a.join("|")
&gt; p(1,2,3,4)
"1|2|3|4"
</pre>

<p>There may be obligatory arguments.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
&gt; p = |x,y,*a| x+a.join("|")+y
&gt; p("(",")",1,2,3,4)
"(1|2|3|4)"
</pre>

<p>In most situations it is preferable to use explicit lists
instead. That is, to simply remove the asterisks. Then the
function call is as follows.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
&gt; p("(",")",[1,2,3,4])
"(1|2|3|4)"
</pre>

<h2 id="opt">
Optional arguments</h2>

<p>Optional arguments can be simulated by
a variadic function with obligatory arguments
(the non-optional ones).
</p>

<pre class="moss">
p = sub|x,y,*a|
  sep = if size(a)==0 then ", " else a[0] end
  return ["(",x,sep,y,")"].join()
end

&gt; p(1,2)
"(1, 2)"
&gt; p(1,2,"|")
"(1|2)"
</pre>

<h2 id="named">
Named arguments</h2>

<p>Currently the language does not support named arguments.
But they can be simulated by dictionarys.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
&gt; p = |d| ["(",d["x"],d["sep"],d["y"],")"].join()
&gt; p({x=1,y=2,sep="|"})
"(1|2)"
</pre>

<h2 id="unpacking">
List unpacking</h2>

<p>Sometimes we want a variadic function <code>f</code> to take the
elements of a list as its arguments.
To make this task simple, there is an
alternative application operation <code>f[a]</code>.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
# variadic summation function
&gt; s = |*a| a.sum()

# normal call
&gt; s(1,2,3,4)
10

# unpacking call
&gt; a = [1,2,3,4]
&gt; s[a]
10
</pre>

<p>Now we can precisely state a feature of <code>print</code>.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
# One can transform
print("abcd") == print("a","b","c","d")
== print[["a","b","c","d"]] == print[list("abcd")]

# So, in general, if s is a string
print(s) == print[list(s)]
</pre>

<p>If an unpacking call gets two arguments, the first
argument is the self argument.
So, if <code>x</code> is an object and <code>m</code> is a two
argument method of <code>x</code>, we have</code>

<pre class="moss">
  x.m(a,b) == x.m[x,[a,b]].
</pre>

<h2 id="argc">
Argument count</h2>

<p>If a function <code>f</code> is not variadic, it has a fixed
number of arguments. This number is determined by
<code>f.argc()</code>.</p>

<p>An application is a general truth table
printing program, that determines the table to print based on
the number of arguments of a given boolean function.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
sub truth_table(f)
  a = [false,true]^f.argc()
  for x in a
    print((x+[f[x]]).map(int))
  end
end
</pre>

<h2 id="methods">
Methods</h2>

<p>In Moss, every function has a hidden argument, called
<code>self</code>. In a function call of the form
<code>x.m(a,b)</code>, the function <code>m</code> takes
<code>a,b</code> as normal arguments, and <code>x</code> as its
self argument. Viewed this way, <code>m</code> is called
<em>a method</em> of <code>x</code>.
</p>

<p>The self argument can be given explicitly:
</p>

<pre class="moss">
  f(a,b) == f(null; a,b),
  x.m(a,b) == x.m(x; a,b).
</pre>

<p>A simple example shows how self arguments work.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
&gt; f = |a,b| [self,a,b]
&gt; f(1,2)
[null, 1, 2]
&gt; f(0; 1,2)
[0, 1, 2]
</pre>

<p>If <code>m</code> is inserted in <code>str.type</code>,
all strings will have <code>m</code> as a method.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
&gt; str.type.m=m
&gt; "alpha".m(1,2)
["alpha", 1, 2]
</pre>

<p>Conversely, we can extract some method of
<code>str.type</code>.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
&gt; "tree".upper()
"TREE"
&gt; upper = str.type.upper
&gt; upper("tree";)
"TREE"
</pre>

<p>But in most cases this is not what we want.
If you want the method <code>upper</code> to be converted into a
function, simply create such a function.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
&gt; upper = |s| s.upper()
&gt; upper("tree")
"TREE"
</pre>

<h2 id="app">Function application
</h2>

<p>As just said, in Moss there is no invisible times. Instead
of <code>ab</code> or <code>a&nbsp;b</code> one must write
<code>a*b</code>. But the function application operator is
invisible. The expression <code>f(x,y)</code> means
</p>
<pre>
  f applied to (x,y).
</pre>
<p>The parenthesis pair on the right hand side is obligatory.
Now note, that the left hand side of this operator can itself
be an expression. If <code>e</code> is some expression, then
<code>(e)(x,y)</code> means
</p>
<pre>
  (e) applied to (x,y).
</pre>
<p>Here are some examples.
</p>
<pre>
f(x)(y) means (f applied to x) applied to y
a[k](x) means a[k] applied to x
</pre>
<p>Let us define addition of functions pointwise.
Look what that means.
</p>
<pre class="moss">
function.type.ADD = sub|g| f=self
  return |x| f(x)+g(x)
end
</pre>
<p>Now one can write <code>(f+g)(x)</code>.</p>

<p>If <code>t</code> is a pair, one can write
<code>f[t]</code> instead of <code>f(t[0],t[1])</code>.
That is a more general way of function application,
because one can always write
<code>f[[t[0],t[1]]]</code>. In general one has
</p>

<pre class="moss">
  f(x,y) == f(null; x,y) == f[[x,y]],
a.m(x,y) == a.m(a; x,y)  == a.m[a,[x,y]].
</pre>


<h2 id="return">Multiple return values
</h2>

<p>In Moss one can assign two values to two variables in one
statement.
</p>
<pre class="moss">
x,y = 360,240
# is the same as
x=360; y=240
</pre>
<p>But there is more going on here. Actually it is a shorthand.
Firstly the numbers on the right hand side are bundled, so that a
list is constructed. The square brackets are simply omitted.
Secondly the list is deconstructed on the right hand side.
The long, more powerful, form of this statement is as follows.
</p>
<pre class="moss">
[x,y] = [360,240]
</pre>

<p>We want <code>x,y</code> to be the coordinates of some
point of a circle line. This can be achieved by the following
function&nbsp;<code>f</code>.
</p>
<pre class="moss">
use math: pi, sin, cos

f = |t,r| [r*cos(2*pi*t), r*sin(2*pi*t)]

for i in 0..11
  x,y = f(i/12,1)
  print("x = ",x,"; y = ",y)
end
</pre>

<h2 id="static">
Static variables</h2>

<p>Sometimes one wants a local variable to survive between two
function calls. We could use a global variable instead of a
local one.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
counter_c=0
sub counter
  counter_c++
  return counter_c
end
</pre>

<p>It is wiser to clarify more clearly that <code>c</code> belongs
to the function. Here is the way to go.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
sub counter
  counter.c++
  return counter.c
end
counter.c=0
</pre>

<p>Now we are able to construct multiple instances of
<code>counter</code>.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
c1 = copy(counter)
c2 = copy(counter)
c2.c = 1000
c3 = copy(c2)
</pre>

<p>There is an alternative construction that is more didactical.
It is secure against any kind of misuse.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
sub new_counter(c)
  return begin
    c++
    return c
  end
end

c1 = new_counter(0)
c2 = new_counter(1000)
c3 = copy(c2)
</pre>

<h2 id="lazy">Lazy evaluation</h2>

<p>Lazy evaluation is not standard in Moss, but one can simulate
it like in Scheme.
</p>

<table class="bt">
<tr>
<th>Moss
<th>Scheme
<tr>
<td><code>t=|| expression
<td><code>(define t (delay expression))</code>
<tr>
<td><code>t()</code>
<td><code>(force t)</code>
</table>

<p>Now let us build such an infinite tree:
</p>
<pre>
                    0
                   / \
                  /   \
                 /     \
                /       \
               /         \
              /           \
             /             \
            /               \
           /                 \
          /                   \
         0                     1
        / \                   / \
       /   \                 /   \
      /     \               /     \
     /       \             /       \
    0         1           1         2
   / \       / \         / \       / \
  0   1     1   2       1   2     2   3
 / \ / \   / \ / \     / \ / \   / \ / \
.. ... .. .. ... ..   .. ... .. .. ... ..
</pre>

<pre class="moss">
# This won't work
sub tree(x)
  table x=x, left=tree(x), right=tree(x+1) end
end
print(tree(0).right.right.right.x)

# We have to use explicit lazy evaluation
sub tree(x)
  table x=x, left=|| tree(x), right=|| tree(x+1) end
end
print(tree(0).right().right().right().x)
</pre>

<p>In some constructions, a value could either be a lazy expression
or a normal value.
In this case, lazy expressions should have their own data type.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
lazy_type = table
  str = || "lazy expression"
end
sub delay(f)
  table[lazy_type] call=f end
end
sub force(x)
  type(x) is lazy_type? x.call(): x
end

t = delay(|| 1+2)
print([force(2), force(t)])
</pre>

<p>But in most constructions, a value is never a function.
In such cases we can simply check for a function.
</p>

<pre class="moss">
sub force(x)
  type(x) is function.type? x(): x
end
print([force(2), force(|| 1+2)])
</pre>
