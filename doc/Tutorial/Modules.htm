<h2 id="Main">Main program</h2>

<p>A computer program consists of a number of subprograms.
The root program shall be called <em>main</em>. It is located in the
<em>main module</em>. But note that any library module can be
used a main program as well. The following construction makes it
possible:

<pre class="moss">
# File m1.moss
use sys

sub main(argv)
  print("argv: ", argv)
end

if sys.main()
  main(sys.argv)
end
</pre>

<p>That variable <code>argv</code> (<em>argument vector</em>)
contains the arguments that are given, if the program is called
by an command-line interface. So
<pre>
$ moss m1 alpha beta gamma
</pre>

<p>performs as it would be called as follows:
<pre class="moss">
use m1

m1.main(["m1", "alpha", "beta", "gamma"])
</pre>


<h2 id="Dynamic-loading">Dynamic loading</h2>

<p>Usually, all modules are loaded at the start of a program.
If there are many of them, initialization can take quite an amount
of time. Also a module might need a large amount of memory space.

<pre class="moss">
use math

sub main
  print(math.exp(1))
end
</pre>

<p>We can achive that module <code>math</code> is only loaded,
if we call <code>main</code>:

<pre class="moss">
sub main
  math = load("math")
  print(math.exp(1))
end
</pre>

<p>This technique is known as <em>dynamic loading</em>.
