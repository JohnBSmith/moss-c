<h3 data-date="20160808" id="new-formatted-printing-policy"
>New formatted printing policy</h3>
<p>Separation between formatted printing to <code>stdout</code> and string
buffers shall be resolved. Formatted printing to <code>stdout</code>
shall be removed in favor of string buffers.
</p>

<h3 data-date="20160808" id="new-formatted-printing-function"
>New formatted printing function</h3>
<p>Moss gets a function and syntax for formatted printing.
I&nbsp;will compare it with equivalents from&nbsp;C.
</p>
<pre>
   C: printf("(%li,%li)",x,y)
Moss: print("({},{})"%[x,y])

   C: snprintf(s,N,"(%li,%li)",x,y)
Moss: s = "({},{})" % [x,y]
</pre>
<p>The template syntax will be similar to <code>format</code>
from Python but may differ more or less.
</p>
<pre>
# Here is an example of proper usage:
a = list(0..10).map(|x| [x,x^2])
buffer=[]
for t in a
  buffer.push("({},{})"%t)
end
s = buffer.join("\n")
print(s)

# More briefly:
/*1*/ a = list(0..10).map(|x| [x,x^2])
/*2*/ s = a.map(|t| "({},{})"%t).join("\n")
/*3*/ print(s)
</pre>
<p>We see a practical pattern: a strict separation between actual
information structure (1), formatting (2) and stdout (3).
</p>
<p>Note: to have advanced output, libraries should be provided
that return tables as HTML5, LaTeX2e and plots as PNG, SVG
as automatically as possible. Whole documents or books (libraries?)
could be generated automatically from data. But one must say
to this, that HTML5 is more easy to use than LaTeX2e.
</p>

<h3 data-date="20160920" id="set-dict-joined"
>Joined datatypes map and set</h3>
<p>As sets are a special case of maps (dictionaries) and set operations
do not interfere with map operations, them can be joined.
Maps with values absent can be considered as sets:
</p>
<pre class="moss indent">
{1, 2} == {1: null, 2: null}
</pre>
<p>Multisets cannot be included as well, because
they introduce problems. For example, '<code>==</code>' behaves
differently if there are keys with <code>d[key]==0</code>.
But it is clear that maps may be used as internal data
structures of multisets. An alternative is, to simpliy monkey patch
the neccessary operations into <code>Map</code>
(<code>Map</code> is the data type of maps).

<h3 data-date="20160930" id="assignment-to-application"
>Assignments to function applications</h3>
<p>A syntactical sugar for assignments to function
applications is added to the language.
</p>
<pre>
1. a.m()=y is equivalent to a.set_m(y)
2. a.m(x1,...,xn)=y is equivalent to a.set_m(x1,...,xn,y)
3. a.m(x) = y1,y2 the same as a.m(x)=[y1,y2]
     and therefore equivalent to a.set_m(x,[y1,y2])
4. a.m1(),a.m2() = t is not possilbe (t=[y1,y2])
5. a[i]()=y is not possible
</pre>
<p>The point in (4) is that the language should be minimalistic
and (4) would blow it up. It is definitely much harder to
implement than (1,2,3) which required less than 40 lines of code.
</p>

<h3 data-date="20161006" id="print-float"
>Printing floating point numbers</h3>

<p>There is a problem with standard printing of floating point
numbers. For example, one can get
<pre class="moss">
&gt; list(0..1:0.2)
[0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6000000000000001, 0.8, 1.0]
</pre>

<pre>
So we can have output of the form 000000000...some digit
and (under other circuumstances)  999999999...some digit.
This is because of printf("%.16g\n",x).

In most cases one has engineering tasks and does not suffer
from slightly lower precision. So I think I will change that
to %.14g to make output more stable. One can always get full
precision by "{g16}"%[x] or even "{g17}"%[x].
(#include &lt;float.h&gt;: DBL_DECIMAL_DIG==17)
</pre>


<h3 data-date="20161107" id="Rust"
>Reimplementation in Rust</h3>

<p>It is clear for me now, that the Moss interpreter must be
rewritten in Rust. I&nbsp;have to struggle with segmentation faults
too often. 

<p><b>Security.</b>
Maybe it is possible to achieve a type safe implementation.

<p><b>Security.</b>
Access to files will be realized by a mandatory access control
system. In that system the main program obtains a <i>right</i> to
access files in some path. This right is given explicitly to the
subprograms that do the task. The difference to the flat model is,
that in the flat model a third party library routine can do anything,
once the main program got the right.

<p><b>Security.</b>
What makes the most headache is a general call of shell commands.
Any call of an external program (e.g. in a scripting language)
can undermine the access control system. Thus such a call is
ill behaved and shall only be possible in the <i>unsafe mode</i>.
Ideally, the unsafe mode is made forbidden outside of a
sandbox environment.


<h3 data-date="20161107" id="self"
>New syntax for a formal self-argument</h3>

<p>The standard syntax for formal self-arguments
has a problem. The following is not possible,
bacause the inner self-argument shadows the outer one:
<pre class="moss indent">
Function.o = |f| |x| self(f(x))
</pre>
<p>One is forced to write instead:
<pre class="moss indent">
Function.o = sub|f|
  g = self
  return |x| g(f(x))
end
</pre>
<p>This problem occurs often if one uses methods, because
closures and higher order functions are frequently used.
Now the idea is, to separate the self-argument via an semicolon
from the other arguments. For actual arguments this syntax is
already possible, but I will provide it also for formal
arguments. Then we have:
<pre class="moss indent">
Function.o = |g;f| |x| g(f(x))
</pre>

<h3 data-date="20170509" id="about-modules"
>About modules</h3>

<p>What is the difference between what follows? Firstly:
<pre class="moss indent">
m = load("m")
</pre>
<p>And secondly:
<pre class="moss indent">
m = eval(read("m.moss"))
</pre>
<p>Behavior is different, because <code>eval</code>
returns a value rather than a module object. But the question that
comes into mind is: should they be equivalent? In order to achieve
that, in a module a module object should be returned explicitely rather
than implicitely. This would also solve another problem: How to
state a module that consists only of a single class or a single
function (e.g. to achieve advanced lazy loading and lazy
evaluation)? The problem here is an oddly looking import statement:
<pre class="moss indent">
use class_name: class_name
# vs.
use class_name
</pre>
<p>Note that <code>eval</code> can be made quite powerful. It can
take an additional argument that specifies information about
the environment. For example, global variable of the environment
are used by default by <code>eval</code>. If a module would be loaded,
<code>eval</code> had to take an empty environment.

<h3 data-date="20170509" id="default-arguments"
>Default arguments</h3>

<p>The interpreter already supports default arguments for
build in functions. Now a function's argument count can simply be
a range. Not given arguments will be filled out with
<code>null</code>. Now
<pre class="moss indent">
sub f(x,y=expression)
</pre>
<p>is simply syntatic sugar for
<pre class="moss indent">
sub f(x,y=null)
  if y is null then y=expression end
</pre>
<p>An implementation is straightforward:
<ol>
<li>Let argument count be a range.
<li>Take the assignment AST and obtain that desired if-AST from it.
<li>Insert this if-AST before function body. To be more precise:
At first, the function body is parsed, and then we have both:
if-AST and body-AST.
</ol>
<p>Now construct:
<pre class="indent">
* block-node
  * if-node-1
  * if-node-2
    ...
  * if-node-n
  * body-node
</pre>
<p>Easy going. At next, default named arguments are stated as follows:
<pre class="moss indent">
sub f(x,d={})
  a = d["a"] if "a" in d else a0
  b = d["b"] if "b" in d else b0
  # ...
end
</pre>
<p>That's clumsy. I believe, default named arguments are very important
for usability and thus should be supported by the language. Now let
<pre class="moss indent">
{a=a0, b=b0} = d
</pre>
<p>be syntactic sugar for
<pre class="moss indent">
a = d["a"] if "a" in d else a0
b = d["b"] if "b" in d else b0
</pre>
<p>Without default arguments it should be more strict: Let
<pre class="moss indent">
{a,b} = d
</pre>
<p>be syntactic sugar for
<pre class="moss indent">
a = d["a"]; b = d["b"]
</pre>
<p>I call this the <em>dictionary unpacking statement</em>.

<p>It took me 100 lines of C&nbsp;code to implement dictionary
unpacking, including construction of a temporary variable if the right
hand side is an expression. I think it was a worthwhile effort.

<p>Finally it could be moved into the arguments list:
<pre class="moss indent">
sub f(x,{a=a0,b=b0})
  # ...
end
</pre>
<p>Furthermore,
<pre class="moss indent">
sub f([x,y])
  # ...
end
</pre>
<p>could be
<pre class="moss indent">
sub f(_t0_)
  x,y = _t0_
  # ...
end
</pre>

<p>In addition I realized (by 30 lines of C&nbsp;Code) syntactic sugar
for named actual arguments:
<pre class="moss indent">
f(x,y,a=e1,b=e2) == f(x,y,{a=e1,b=e2})
</pre>
<p>They may appear in any order, independently from positional
arguments. That is a little more welfare than simply omitting
the curly brackets.

<h3 data-date="20170525" id="private-variables"
>Private variables</h3>

<p>At first I recall that
<pre class="moss indent">
begin ... end
</pre>
<p>is syntatic sugar for:
<pre class="moss indent">
(sub|| ... end)()
</pre>

<p>Often we want to create a local variable, use it in one or
more functions, and forget it afterwarts. Thus we want to have
a <i>local scope</i>, so that the variable does not exist outside
of this scope. In Moss I have used this ugly construction so far:
<pre class="moss indent">
f = begin
  n = 42
  return |x| n*x
end
</pre>
<p>But if one wants to bind some value to more than one function,
this construction becomes even more unpleasant:
<pre class="moss indent">
f,g = begin
  n = 42
  f = |x| n*x
  g = |x| x+n
  return f,g
end
</pre>

<p>In Lua it is possible to restrict variables to a local scope:
<pre class="indent">
do
  local n = 42
  function f(x)
    return n*x
  end
  function g(x)
    return x+n
  end
end

print(f(2))
</pre>

<p>I did not realize until now that this is perfectly possible in
my own programming language too:
<pre class="moss indent">
begin
  global f,g
  n = 42
  f = |x| n*x
  g = |x| x+n
end

print(f(2))
</pre>
<p>Furthermore, this actually solves the problem of having variables
that are restricted to a module.<sup>1</sup> And fortunately these
variables can be accessed faster, since local variables are stored in
a stack frame rather than the dictionary of global variables.

<p>A problem that remains is mutual recursion. In JavaScript this
is solved by making it possible to use a local variable that
is defined later on. For now, in Moss one would need to switch to
global variables for this purpose.

<p class="footnote">Footnote 1: It would be possible to achieve that
a variable may be declared to be local to a module (<i>module scope</i>).
In&nbsp;C known as a <i>static</i> variable. Such a variable would also
be stored inside an array rather than a dictionary. But to me
<code>begin-end</code> is nicer and more powerful as it leads
to more fine-grained constructions.

<h3 data-date="20170924" id="use"
>Definition of the import statement</h3>

<p>In Moss, a module, for example <i>math</i>, is made available by
the following statement:
<pre class="moss indent">
use math
</pre>
<p>The implementation so far was an internal import-function that
added <i>math</i> to the dictionary of global variables.
A change to this behavior will be proposed now. The import-statement
will be made syntactic sugar to:
<pre class="moss indent">
math = load("math")
</pre>
<p>This has the advantage that <i>math</i> can be a local variable
now. We recapitulate that a private variable is a (can be modeled
as a) local variable of a block (in Moss: <code>begin-end</code>).

<p>The full syntax is as follows:
<pre class="moss indent">
# (A)
use pathnode.pathnode.m: f,g

# (B)
use malias=pathnode.pathnode.m: falias=f, galias=g
</pre>
<p>This is defined to be syntactic sugar to:
<pre class="moss indent">
# (A)
m = load("pathnode/pathnode/m")
f = m.f
g = m.g

# (B)
malias = load("pathnode/pathnode/m")
falias = malias.f
galias = malias.g
</pre>
<p>In Addition:
<pre class="moss">
  use m:*
# is meant to be
  m = load("m")
  gtab().update(record(m))

# and

  use m=(expression): f, g
# is meant to be
  m = load(expression)
  f = m.f; g = m.g
</pre>
<p>In theory, <code>expression</code> could also be an URL etc.


<h3 data-date="20170930" id="assert"
>Assert statement</h3>

<p>The assert statement was added to the language:
<pre class="moss indent">
assert condition, text
</pre>
<p>It is implemented as syntatic sugar, because <code>text</code>
shall be lazily evaluated. So we have:
<pre class="moss indent">
if not condition
  assertion_failed(text)
end
</pre>
<p>Example of usage:
<pre class="moss">
sub pow(x,n)
  assert type(n) is Int and n&gt;=0, "pow(x,n), n: Int, n&gt;=0"
  y=1
  for k in 1..n
    y=y*x
  end
  return y
end

print(pow(2,-2))
# Assertion failed: pow(x,n), n: Int, n&gt;=0.
</pre>

<p>A failed assertion results in an ordinary exception
that is shown together with a stack trace.

<h3 data-date="20171024" id="embedded-slicing-ability"
>Embedded slicing ability</h3>

<p>If we have a string <code>s</code>, it is expensive to
create a slice <code>s[i..j]</code>. But as <code>s</code> is
immutable, a slice object could be returned, without copying data.
Now we can make every string a slice object, if we say we have a
immutable data array and a <code>(pointer,size)</code> to a part of it.

<p>At first this contradicts with the string being a struct with
a flexible array last member. We would need a double allocation.
At next, the data array has to contain a reference counter.
Ideally the data array is a struct with a flexible array last member.
Not to forget that the string object itself needs an independet
reference counter.

<p>This sounds more complicated. So what have we won? Now we can
take slices and slices of slices without the need of allocating
and copying around data. Take into mind the basic algorithm that
searches a substring in a string.

<p>Interestingly this is an implementation detail that is
transparent to the programming language because strings are
chosen to be immutable.

<p>Moving further, such a behavior is also interesting for
dynamic arrays (type <code>List</code> in Moss). If a slice
is obtained from an array, the arrays size should become immutable.
The information about immutable size, immutable data and
slicing can be modeled as an option type (extra behavior flag),
to separate it from the standard behavior. A problem is again,
that the data array needs an independent reference counter.

<p>Alternatively, we could have a sum type (a tagged union)
that chooses wether to point to data or to slice another array.

<p>So, what have we won? Let's take a look on some naive algorithms:
<pre class="moss indent">
# Naive quicksort
qsort = |a| ([] if size(a)==0 else
  qsort(a[1..].filter(|x| x&lt;a[0]))+[a[0]]+
  qsort(a[1..].filter(|x| x&gt;=a[0])))

# Naive sieve of Eratosthenes
sieve = |a| ([] if size(a)==0 else
  [a[0]]+sieve(a[1..].filter(|x| x%a[0]!=0)))
</pre>
<p>Many huge copies are created by <code>a[1..]</code>.
The algorithms could be made a bit more quick and memory
friendly, but it hardly is worthwhile as these algorithms are
terribly inefficient.

<h3 data-date="20171120" id="null-coalescing"
>Null coalescing operator</h3>

<p>In Moss, the index operations <code>a[i]</code>, <code>m[key]</code>
are strict. If <code>i</code> is out of bounds or <code>key</code>
is not found, an exception will be thrown. Now we could introduce
sloppy index operations <code>a(i)</code>, <code>a(key)</code>,
that return <code>null</code> if <code>i</code> is out of bounds or
<code>key</code> is not found. That's right, we simply overload the
function call operator.

<p>Furthermore we introduce the null coalescing operator as
"<code>a else b</code>". Now these to statements are
semantically equivalent:

<pre class="moss indent">
y = m[key] if key in m else x

y = m(key) else x
</pre>

<p>In both statements, <code>x</code> is lazily evaluated.


<h3 data-date="20171120" id="reflection"
>Better reflection support</h3>

<p>In Moss, there is the member access operation "<code>a.x</code>".
One can have reflection this way:

<pre class="moss indent">
y = record(a)["x"]
</pre>

<p>Here the problem emerges, that the ordinary index operation
does not respect the prototype chain. Now we find, that an
expression "<code>a.x</code>" is parsed into an AST
<code>(dot a "x")</code>. But the compiler
ever since the beginning was able to compile the more general
AST <code>(dot a x)</code> where <code>a</code> and <code>x</code>
are arbitray expressions. The recursive desecent may simply take an
atom after the dot. Thus I will introduce the general syntax
"<code>a.(x)</code>". So, adding very few lines to the compiler allows
us nice reflection with respect to the prototype chain. For clarity,
we have:

<pre class="moss indent">
a.x == a.("x")
</pre>
